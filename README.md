# stockDataCompressionEngine

A C++ project that compresses and decompresses Apple stock price data using delta encoding.  
Logs performance metrics including compression ratio, time taken, and validation status.

## 📂 Input Format

CSV file with the following header and data format:

```
Date,Close/Last,Volume,Open,High,Low
07/14/2025,$208.62,38840110,$209.93,$210.91,$207.54
```

## 🛠️ Features

- Delta-encodes numeric fields (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume)
- Binary compression with custom format
- Decompression and exact restoration
- Validation of data integrity
- Unique run ID logging with timestamps
- Benchmarking: compression ratio, time (ms)
